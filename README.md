# ⚠️Warning
Windows Security (and any other antivirus) may false flag this program as a virus. I'm working on a fix for this, but for now you'll have to download the Butterfly Launcher to a folder that's excluded from your Windows Security/other antivirus. Learn how to exclude a folder from Windows Security here: https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/add-an-exclusion-to-windows-security-811816c0-4dfd-af4a-47e4-c301afe13b26
