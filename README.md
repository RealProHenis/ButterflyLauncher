# 🦋Butterfly Launcher
The Butterfly Launcher allows you to download & play old versions of Fortnite!<br>

# ⬇️DOWNLOAD 
Latest Version: https://github.com/RealProHenis/ButterflyLauncher/raw/main/ButterflyLauncher_Latest.zip

# ⚠️WARNING
Windows Security (and any other antivirus) may false flag this program as a virus. I'm working on a fix for this, but for now you'll have to download the Butterfly Launcher to a folder that's excluded from your Windows Security/other antivirus. Learn how to exclude a folder from Windows Security here: https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/add-an-exclusion-to-windows-security-811816c0-4dfd-af4a-47e4-c301afe13b26

# 🚨REQUIREMENTS
Butterfly Launcher requires .NET 6.0 Desktop Runtime.<br>Download it here: https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/thank-you/runtime-desktop-6.0.13-windows-x64-installer
