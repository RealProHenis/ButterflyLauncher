## ‚ö†Ô∏èWarning
Windows Security & other antivirus software might false flag the Butterfly Launcher as a virus.<br><br>
The Butterfly Launcher injects special code into old versions of Fortnite in order to make them playable. These actions are sometimes interpretted by antivirus software to be malicious.<br><br>
To prevent Windows from deleting the Butterfly Launcher or causing other issues, you can add an exclusion for it in Windows Security. You'll need to add an exclusion for `ButterflyLauncher` folder, located in local appdata. *`(ex. C:\Users\YourName\AppData\Local\ButterflyLauncher)`* <br>
If you're using a third-party antivirus, (Norton, McAfee, etc.) you'll need to add the exclusion for them as well.

**NOTE:** You only need to add an exclusion if you're having issues playing old Fortnite <br><br>
